Subscription and Payment Information

WantBoard offers optional premium subscriptions through Apple In-App Purchases. All payments are processed directly by Apple.

Limited data may be processed by trusted service providers, such as Apple and RevenueCat, strictly for authentication and subscription management. These providers are required to protect your information and use it only for the intended purpose.
